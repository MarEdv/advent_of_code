# Advent of Code
These are my solutions to Advent of Code: http://adventofcode.com/. 

I started out with the puzzels for 2016: http://adventofcode.com/2016.

For a while now, I have missed having a "goto-script-language" that I really feel comfortable with. I start out using Ruby and later I may change depending on how I like Ruby. This means that the code will not be idiomatic and in the name of personal development, please feel free to comment on the code and suggest improvements!
