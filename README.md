# Advent of Code
These are my solutions to Advent of Code: http://adventofcode.com/. 

I started out with the puzzels for 2016: http://adventofcode.com/2016.

For a while now, I have missed having a "goto-script-language" that I
feel really comfortable with. I start out using Ruby and later I may
change depending on how I like Ruby. This means that the code will not
be idiomatic and in the name of personal development, please feel free
to comment on the code and suggest improvements!

I started out writing Ruby in the form of script files (day 1, day 2 and day 3).
Then I wanted to create more of a real project for each day, with unit tests and such.
I found Rubynu, which is a scaffolding utility for Ruby projects [https://github.com/mcrowe/Rubynu](https://github.com/mcrowe/Rubynu)
and I use it to generate a project for each day. So far, I have used it for day 4 and day 5.
